### I focus on developing applications for the Web
I focused on new technologies that are open-source and modular.

### Symfony!
In my projects, I generally work with Symfony Components. I develop applications with my own framework(ParFramework) consisting of components, not a complete Symfony, Zend or Doctrine. I use the best parts of these.

### I'm currently working on two different projects
