# 👋 Hi there, I'm Berk.
❓ On Github I am known as Par274 (aka Scarecrow)

### 🔭 I focus on developing applications for the Web
I focused on new technologies that are open-source and modular.

### ⚡Symfony!
In my projects, I generally work with Symfony Components. I develop applications with my own framework(ParFramework) consisting of components, not a complete Symfony, Zend or Doctrine. I use the best parts of these.

### 🌱 I'm currently working on two different projects
