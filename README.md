### I focus on developing applications for the web, with an interest in open-source and modular technologies.

Recently, I’ve been exploring C++ and desktop-oriented technologies like Tauri to better understand native boundaries and performance considerations, while already being comfortable with React on the frontend side.

### Symfony

I work mainly with Symfony Components and build applications around a custom component-based framework (ParFramework).  
Instead of using a full-stack framework, I prefer assembling only the parts I actually need.

### I'm currently working on two different projects
